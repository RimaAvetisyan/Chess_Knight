# Chess_Knight_Moves
This project implements a chessboard game where a horse (knight) moves based on the player's input, with visual feedback showing the current position, possible moves, and a timer that tracks gameplay duration. The game includes a move counter and a history of all moves made by the player, making it easy to track progress.

## Get Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Start the app: **
   ```bash
    npx expo start

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
* development build
* Android emulator
* iOS simulator
* Expo Go, a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
You can start developing by editing the files inside the app directory. This project uses file-based routing.
